# Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Artificial Intelligence

This project implements a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision and AI techniques. It aims to enhance road safety by monitoring drivers’ facial cues such as eye closure duration, blink patterns, and yawning frequency, and issuing timely alerts to prevent fatigue-induced accidents.

## 🔍 Overview

Drowsy driving contributes to thousands of road accidents each year. This project introduces a lightweight, non-intrusive system that uses webcam video feeds to detect signs of driver fatigue with sub-second latency. Unlike physiological-sensor-based methods (e.g., EEG), this system focuses on visible indicators such as prolonged eyelid closure and microsleep patterns.

## 💡 Key Features

- Real-time detection of eye closure, blinking, and yawning using OpenCV
- Sub-0.5s latency from detection to alert generation
- Adaptive fatigue scoring with threshold-based warning escalation
- Audio and vibration feedback to alert the driver
- Robust under variable lighting conditions and with glasses
- Modular architecture suitable for edge deployment (e.g., embedded Linux)

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Haar Cascade Classifiers
- Real-time Video Streaming
- Linux (Ubuntu 13.04 environment)
- Audio & Haptic Feedback Modules

## ⚙️ System Flow

1. **Image Acquisition** – Capture video frames using a webcam.
2. **Face & Eye Detection** – Use Haar classifiers to isolate facial landmarks.
3. **Behavioral Feature Extraction** – Analyze blink rate, eyelid closure, and yawning.
4. **Fatigue Scoring** – Classify frames based on thresholds (e.g., eye closure > 0.5s).
5. **Alert Mechanism** – Trigger audio and vibration alerts in case of drowsiness.

## 📈 Performance & Results

- Achieved high accuracy across test subjects with varying lighting and facial features
- Resilient to IR interference and eyeglass reflection
- Delivered prompt feedback (<0.5s) with low false positives

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Integration of emotion detection for behavioral context
- Demographic-specific alert tuning using age/gender models
- Fusion of visual + audio signals (e.g., yawning sound detection)
- Reinforcement learning for adaptive alert intensity

## 🛡️ Impact

This system provides a low-cost, deployable solution to reduce drowsiness-related accidents, especially in commercial transport. It aligns with the push toward intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and onboard driver monitoring solutions (DMS).
